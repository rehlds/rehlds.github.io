# Why You Shouldn't DM Developers

Every day, open-source developers encounter questions and problems from users. But did you know that sending questions via direct message is far from the best way to get an answer? In reality, many issues are solved much faster and more efficiently when discussed in public channels. This applies to the ReHLDS project and many other open-source initiatives.

When you DM, the issue remains "in the shadows." Only you and the developer are aware of the problem. Posting a question or bug on GitHub Issues or GitHub Discussions allows not only the developer but also other community members to assist you in finding a solution. After all, the open-source community operates on the principles of mutual help and knowledge exchange. The more people involved in solving the issue, the quicker it will be resolved.

## Why Post on GitHub, Not DM?

Developers are busy people. Every direct message response takes time away from tasks like fixing bugs, adding new features, or optimizing performance. While the developer spends time gathering information about your issue, other users could be offering a solution.

Why is this important?

1. **Open discussions**: When an issue or question becomes public, other users can share their solutions or suggestions. This fosters an active collaborative atmosphere.
  
2. **Public visibility**: Everyone can see your question and help you find a solution, significantly increasing the chance of a quick resolution.

3. **Resource conservation**: Developers' time is limited, and it should be focused on addressing larger and more complex issues, not resolving simple cases that could be handled in public spaces.

## The Effectiveness of Communication in Open Source

Platforms like GitHub Issues or Discussions are designed for users and developers to discuss projects and their issues. It's important to understand that end-users can't always objectively assess the scale of a problem. Sometimes, what seems like a critical bug may actually be a simple misunderstanding or installation error. This is why open discussions help all project participants assess the real importance of an issue and resolve it as quickly as possible.

## How to Ask Questions on GitHub

1. Be specific: Describe the steps that led to the error.
2. Provide context: Specify the system you're using and the versions involved.
3. Attach logs: This significantly speeds up diagnosis and issue resolution.

Instead of DMing, create an issue with a detailed description of the problem. This will not only speed up the resolution but also help you avoid unnecessary waiting and uncertainty.

## Contributing to the Project

Remember, every question or message in public channels, whether it's a discussion on GitHub or in a chat, is a contribution to the project's development. This is much more valued than just communicating via DMs. Public channels help create a community where knowledge and ideas are exchanged faster than they would be in private messages.
