# What is ReHLDS?

ReHLDS (Reverse-engineered Half-Life Dedicated Server) is a reworked and enhanced server engine based on Valve's original HLDS (Half-Life Dedicated Server). Initially built upon build 6153, ReHLDS was developed as an open-source project to address numerous issues and limitations present in the original engine. Today, it serves as a stable and secure server solution for games such as Half-Life and Counter-Strike 1.6, as well as other titles built on the HLDS engine.

## Why Use ReHLDS?

ReHLDS offers significant advantages for both server administrators and developers. The project is supported by an active community of developers who continually integrate the latest security enhancements, performance optimizations, and extended configuration options. Below are some key advantages of using ReHLDS in modern HLDS server management:

### Key Benefits of ReHLDS

1. **Enhanced Security**  
   ReHLDS includes numerous security fixes and improvements to protect servers from known vulnerabilities in the original engine. This makes it the preferred choice for servers prioritizing defense against exploits and potential attacks.

2. **Performance Optimization**  
   ReHLDS incorporates various optimizations that enhance server performance while reducing hardware load, leading to increased server stability, even with high player counts.

3. **Increased Limits**  
   With ReHLDS, server limits have been expanded, allowing for greater flexibility and performance improvements that surpass the original HLDS constraints.

4. **Extended Modding Capabilities**  
   ReHLDS provides an extensive range of tools and enhancements for developers seeking to create custom plugins or modifications. Added improvements make modding and integration of custom content more flexible and efficient.

5. **Compatibility and Stability**  
   Despite the many enhancements, ReHLDS maintains full compatibility with the original HLDS, supporting all existing mods and plugins, including AMX Mod X and Metamod. This ensures seamless migration for existing projects and plugins without requiring significant modifications.

## ReHLTV Integration

ReHLDS is packaged with the ReHLTV engine, which brings its own set of improvements, fixes, and increased limits for Half-Life Television (HLTV). ReHLTV is designed to complement ReHLDS, providing an optimized and enhanced solution for capturing and broadcasting game sessions.

## History and Community

ReHLDS was launched to overcome longstanding issues and limitations within the original HLDS, which had gone unaddressed for years. Since its inception, ReHLDS has evolved significantly, thanks to a non-commercial community of passionate developers who continue to improve, extend, and maintain the project. The ReHLDS community focuses on creating a high-quality experience for both players and server administrators by constantly advancing the capabilities of the engine.

ReHLDS not only preserves the spirit of the original HLDS but also provides a powerful solution for those seeking flexibility, stability, and security when managing their game servers.
