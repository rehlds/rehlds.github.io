# What is Metamod-r?

Metamod-r is an improved version of the original [Metamod](http://metamod.org/) written by _Will Day_ for Half-Life 1 with some additions from [Jussi Kivilinna](https://github.com/jkivilin) ([Metamod-p](https://github.com/jkivilin/metamod-p)), a plugin/DLL manager that functions as an intermediary layer between the Half-Life Engine and a Half-Life game mod.  This setup allows the dynamic loading and unloading of mod-like DLL plugins, making it possible to add custom functionality to the Half-Life server or any game mod running on the engine.

Based on the original Metamod developed by Will Day, Metamod-r incorporates significant improvements, including code optimizations and enhanced performance, while maintaining full compatibility with all plugins designed for Metamod. Key enhancements in Metamod-r include optimizations from Metamod-p, an earlier modified version by Jussi Kivilinna, along with further refinements.

## Key Features and Advantages of Metamod-r

1. **Performance Optimizations**  
   Metamod-r features a highly optimized core, implemented using a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which significantly improves performance compared to the original Metamod. This allows smoother operation and reduced resource usage, especially under high server load.

2. **Cleaner, More Efficient Codebase**  
   The Metamod-r project involved thorough code refinement, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. This enhanced code quality contributes to both performance and stability, making it an ideal choice for modern Half-Life 1 server setups.

3. **Enhanced Compatibility with ReHLDS**  
   Metamod-r is fully compatible with both the original HLDS (Half-Life Dedicated Server) and ReHLDS, the reverse-engineered HLDS. Running Metamod-r with ReHLDS (API 3.1+) unlocks additional performance benefits and improvements, further enhancing the server experience.

4. **Dynamic Plugin Management**  
   As with the original Metamod, Metamod-r supports dynamic loading and unloading of plugins, allowing administrators to customize the server environment without restarting. This flexibility makes it easy to experiment with different plugin configurations to find the optimal setup.

## History and Purpose

Metamod-r was developed to address the limitations and aging codebase of the original Metamod. Building on the foundations set by Will Day, and later expanded by Jussi Kivilinna in Metamod-p, Metamod-r brings these improvements together into a single, highly optimized version. The projectâ€™s main goal was to modernize Metamod while preserving its core functionality and compatibility, making it a preferred choice for Half-Life 1 servers today.
