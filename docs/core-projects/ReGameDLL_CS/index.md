# What is ReGameDLL_CS?

ReGameDLL_CS is a reverse-engineered version of the original Counter-Strike game library (mp.dll / cs.so) based on HLDS (build 6153 beta) using DWARF debug information from the Linux version of HLDS (cs.so). This re-engineering effort allows for a more stable and feature-rich experience for Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero servers.

## Key Features and Improvements

ReGameDLL_CS is designed to provide an improved, stable GameDLL with extended functionality for mods and plugins. Below are some of the key improvements and features:

1. **Performance and Network Optimizations**  
   The GameDLL includes numerous optimizations, particularly in network performance, reducing latency and improving server response times during gameplay.

2. **Extended Game Settings and Features**  
   ReGameDLL_CS introduces a variety of new and enhanced in-game settings, allowing server administrators and modders greater control over gameplay. Additionally, expanded API support enables a broader range of custom mods and plugins, providing more flexibility and configurability.

3. **Enhanced Security**  
   The re-engineered codebase includes critical security improvements, mitigating common vulnerabilities and providing a safer environment for players and server operators.

4. **Developer and Map makers Support**  
   ReGameDLL_CS provides additional functionality aimed at developers and map designers, including enhanced options for .bsp maps and extended scripting possibilities. This allows for deeper customization and the creation of richer, more complex game environments.

## Important Compatibility Note

:::warning

ReGameDLL_CS is not binary compatible with the original HLDS, as it was compiled using different compilers from those used for the original Counter-Strike mod. Plugins that rely on binary code analysis (such as Orpheu) may not function correctly with ReGameDLL_CS.

:::

## Installation and Usage

ReGameDLL_CS is fully compatible with the official Counter-Strike 1.6 and Condition Zero mods by Valve. To install ReGameDLL_CS, download the binaries and replace the original `mp.dll` or `cs.so` files in your server setup.

### Additional Options

- **Installing zBot for CS 1.6**  
  - Extract all files from the zBot archive.
  - Add the `-bots` option to the HLDS command line.
  
- **Enabling CSCZ Hostage AI in CS 1.6**  
  - Extract all files from the archive.
  - Add the `-host-improv` option to the HLDS command line.

ReGameDLL_CS brings together stability, security, and expanded capabilities, making it an ideal choice for those seeking to enhance and maintain their Counter-Strike servers with modern tools and options.
