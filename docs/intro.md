# Welcome to the ReHLDS Documentation

The ReHLDS project is a collection of re-engineered and optimized components designed to enhance the experience of running Half-Life Dedicated Servers (HLDS), particularly for games like Counter-Strike 1.6 and other HLDS-based titles. These projects offer improvements in performance, security, customization, and extendability, providing a more modern and robust platform for game servers.

## What You'll Find in the ReHLDS Ecosystem

Our organization maintains several key projects that work seamlessly together or independently to improve server stability, flexibility, and functionality.

### ReHLDS

ReHLDS is a reverse-engineered version of the original HLDS engine, aimed at delivering a more secure, efficient, and customizable server experience. Built on the original HLDS 6153 build, ReHLDS introduces numerous performance optimizations, expanded configuration options, and improved network handling.

### Metamod-r

Metamod-r is an optimized version of the original Metamod, acting as a dynamic plugin manager between the HLDS engine and game mods. It enables servers to load and unload plugins without restarts, making server customization more flexible. Metamod-r is designed to work with both HLDS and ReHLDS, providing an improved core with enhanced performance and a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

### ReGameDLL_CS

ReGameDLL_CS is a re-engineered version of the Counter-Strike GameDLL, providing server admins and modders with an enhanced, stable base for running Counter-Strike 1.6 and Condition Zero. It offers extended APIs, additional game settings, and improved security, enabling advanced modifications and enhanced control over server settings.

### ReAPI

ReAPI is a AMXModX module providing APIs for ReHLDS, ReGameDLL, and Metamod plugins (e.g., ReUnion, ReVoice).

## Why Choose ReHLDS Projects?

The ReHLDS suite is intended for server administrators, modders, and developers who want more control, improved stability, and advanced customization options for their HLDS-based servers. With regular updates and contributions from dedicated developers, ReHLDS components are reliable, compatible, and ideal for maintaining high-performance servers for todayâ€™s gaming needs.

## Getting Started

Each project has its own set of documentation to help you install, configure, and make the most of the features offered. To start exploring, select a project from the navigation menu, or visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ReHLDS) for the latest releases and updates.
